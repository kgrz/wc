A Shoddy Word count program
============================


Run the `wc.2.go` program with `go run wc.2.go`. The first version with
custom buffer size doesn't yet work. There has to be a simpler way to do
that, and my ugly truth table in the comments wasn't helping.

Both versions only work with ASCII input for now. I don't think they
will cater to hyphenated hard-wrapped lines too.
